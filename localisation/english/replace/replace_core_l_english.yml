 FE_IRONMAN:0 "Ironman Mode (NOT RECOMMENDED)"
 FE_IRONMAN_TOOLTIP:0 "In Ironman mode, console cheats are disabled and the game is automatically saved regularly to a single file. In games played with this setting, there is no turning back.\nSince using the Ironman mode blocks your console commands, it is better to turn off this feature to get supported for the mod gameplay (bugs etc.)"
