 heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Armored Cruiser IV"
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armor light, the weapons load can be increased."
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."
 heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Upscaled, longer and heavier designs with rapid-fire armaments are features in these final stages of heavy cruiser development."
 ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Although bound by the stipulations of the Washington Naval Treaty, the cruiser is still the most flexible warship. This hull allows construction of a light cruiser for screening and scouting, or a heavy cruiser to support the battleline."
 ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The next generation of cruisers features new engine arrangements that improve survivability, as well as space for dedicated aircraft facilities."
 ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As cruisers around the world get more powerful and capable, new and larger hulls are needed to hold all the extra equipment needed."
 ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Influenced by wartime experiences, the latest generation of cruisers have a rearranged superstructure to allow wider fields of fire for anti-air armaments and new internal layouts to support the use of radar."

 USA_battleship_1:0 "South Carolina Class"
 USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first dreadnought in the U.S. Navy. Due to limited dimensions, the ship carried relatively weak armament and had a low speed. Battleships of her class were the first to receive super-firing turrets. This meant she could fire a full broadside with all main battery guns."
 USA_battleship_2:0 "Wyoming Class"
 USA_battleship_2_desc:0 "A typical battleship of the first generation in the U.S. Navy. The ship was very well-balanced for her time. In contrast to her predecessors, the ship was armed with numerous main battery guns with a longer firing range. Turbine-driven propulsion could produce quite a decent speed for a dreadnought."
 USA_battleship_3:0 "New York Class"
 USA_battleship_3_desc:0 "Developed from the Wyoming class. In contrast to her predecessor, she featured reinforced armor and main battery guns of a larger caliber. When upgraded, she received reasonably good AA defense and improved torpedo protection."
 USA_battleship_4:0 "Colorado Class"
 USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "She became the final phase in development of conventional battleships that featured very heavy armor protection for the vitally important parts of a ship. Key differences from her predecessors were her 406mm main guns and a novel torpedo protection system. In speed, she was outclassed by other battleships of her time."

Kawachi’s fire control capabilities were strongly affected by the diversity of calibers of her numerous guns. Similar to other warships of her time, Kawachi had insufficient horizontal armor protection and weak torpedo protection."
 JAP_battleship_2:0 "Fusō Class"

 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "Nagato had long remained the most powerful warship in the Imperial Japanese Navy. She had good armor and carried 410mm main battery guns. In the 1930s, the ship was modernized to receive more powerful torpedo protection."
